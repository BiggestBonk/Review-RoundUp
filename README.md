A web-page to display games I've played along with their general information (provided by IGDB) and a brief review.

The games will be primarily displayed in a list displaying it's title and cover art, which can be clicked on to be taken to it's specific page 

The information that each entry will include is:
-The Title of the game
-Release Date
-Platforms it released on
-Aggregate Metacritic score
-Recorded sales
-A small review written by myself
-A yes or no denoting whether I'd recommend the game, or a longer answer if necessary

The current build displays the games I'm currently playing with their respective cover art and title.
